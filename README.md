Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.

Terraform has compared your real infrastructure against your configuration and found no differences, so no changes are needed.

Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

* Compile the custom plugin

```
bash plugin.sh
```

* Modify the terraform project to use the custom plugin

```
bash modify-main.sh
```

_sample_:

```
vagrant@vagrant:~$ bash modify-main.sh
vagrant@vagrant:~$
```

* Initialize and apply again

```
terraform -chdir=/vagrant init && terraform -chdir=/vagrant apply

Terraform has made some changes to the provider dependency selections recorded
in the .terraform.lock.hcl file. Review those changes and commit them to your
version control system if they represent changes you intended to make.

null_resource.null: Refreshing state... [id=3161630483811464142]

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # linux_group.testgroup will be created
  + resource "linux_group" "testgroup" {
      + gid    = (known after apply)
      + id     = (known after apply)
      + name   = "testgroup"
      + system = false
    }

  # linux_user.testuser1 will be created
  + resource "linux_user" "testuser1" {
      + gid    = (known after apply)
      + id     = (known after apply)
      + name   = "testuser1"
      + system = false
      + uid    = (known after apply)
    }

  # linux_user.testuser2 will be created
  + resource "linux_user" "testuser2" {
      + gid    = (known after apply)
      + id     = (known after apply)
      + name   = "testuser2"
      + system = false
      + uid    = (known after apply)
    }

Plan: 3 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Changes to Outputs:
  + testgroup-id = (known after apply)
  + testuser1-id = (known after apply)
  + testuser2-id = (known after apply)

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

linux_group.testgroup: Creating...
linux_group.testgroup: Creation complete after 0s [id=1001]
linux_user.testuser1: Creating...
linux_user.testuser2: Creating...
linux_user.testuser2: Creation complete after 0s [id=1001]
linux_user.testuser1: Creation complete after 0s [id=1002]

Apply complete! Resources: 3 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

testgroup-id = "1001"
testuser1-id = "1002"
testuser2-id = "1001"
```

### Cleanup

* Disconnect from the VM

```
exit
```

_sample_:

```
vagrant@vagrant:~$ exit
logout
Connection to 127.0.0.1 closed.
```

* Destroy the VM

```
vagrant destroy
````

_sample_:

```
vagrant destroy
    default: Are you sure you want to destroy the 'default' VM? [y/N] y
==> default: Forcing shutdown of VM...
==> default: Destroying VM and associated drives...
```
